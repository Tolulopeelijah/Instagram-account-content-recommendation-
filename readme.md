This repository contains my implementation of a recommender system based on matrix factorization techniques.

The work follows the explanations and methodology presented in:

Nicolas Hug’s four-part blog series on matrix factorization, which provides an intuitive and practical introduction grounded in PCA and SVD concepts:

Simon Funk’s original Netflix Prize write-up, where he introduced the FunkSVD approach to collaborative filtering:

Some conceptual foundations (PCA/SVD intuition) are explored separately here: https://github.com/Tolulopeelijah/Linear-algebra-for-ML-experiments-
